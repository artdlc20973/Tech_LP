Nothing is more personal than your health information. Helping you keep it confidential and secure is as important to us as it is to you. What you choose to share for research, and with which study, is controlled entirely by you. Any data collected through the Research app will be encrypted if you have a passcode set on your device. Once shared, it is stored securely in a system within Apple that is designed to meet the technical safeguard requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Apple will not have access to any contact information or other identifying data that you provide through the Research app. And you can withdraw from any study at any time, ending any future data collection.</p>
